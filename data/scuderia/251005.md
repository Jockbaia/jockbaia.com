I’ve never liked albums that cram political statements in just for the sake of it, as they end up feeling like preachy rants. "Joy as an Act of Resistance" is the perfect counterexample. It delivers important messages with charm and authenticity through a burst of punk brilliance. Within that record, "Danny Nedelko" stands out as a certified banger.

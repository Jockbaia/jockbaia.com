I'm a big fan of the relaxing, laid-back tracks from Earl Sweatshirt: furthermore, I'm happy to hear that he is now in a better place, surrounded by the love of its family and its community. "Live, Laugh, Love" is basically the Yang of "Some Rap Songs", another record from him that I loved, masterfully balancing themes of depression and despair with glimmers of hope. "Tourmaline" stands out as a celebration of the light finally breaking through.

This summer I spent a few days in Corsica, a stunning island with rich culture, strong identity and welcoming people. While tuning into local radio stations, I took a deep dive in Corsican popular music. Among the artists I discovered, "I Muvrini" became a personal favorite. Their song "A rombu di cantà" is a folk ballad with a melancholic yet uplifting chorus, dealing with themes of resilience and hope in time of hardship.

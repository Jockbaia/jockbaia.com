Action Bronson. The only one capable of say "Ever since a fetus, I had visions of a leader / 
Purple X6 truck driven by a cheetah" with a straight face and be totally believable while doing it. "Live from the Moon" is one of those cases where the album version is good but the live one completely blows it out of the park. The Tiny Desk version of this track, ending with an otherworldly sax solo by Yung Mehico, is 100% worth a listen if you haven't already.

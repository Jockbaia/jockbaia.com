The first time I heard 'Invaders Must Die' I was 14 years old and it hit me like a sledgehammer. A noisy, playful record packed with bangers and with some top-notch sampling, as thrilling to play as it was back then. My younger self loved the title track but this time I'm going with "Piranha": most people say it's the worst track on the record but, as sometimes happens, I strongly disagree.

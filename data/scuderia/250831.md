Always down to listen to some new Flume. He's truly one of the most unique electronic artists of our generation and a trailblazer of the future bass genre. This new collaboration with Emma Louise is really great too, with her soothing voice really complementing the glitchy soundscapes. "Shine, Glow, Listen" is one of my favorites: it reminds me of something that SOPHIE would have produced.

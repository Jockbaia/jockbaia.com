This week I watched "The Smashing Machine", a new flick from A24 telling the story of Mark Kerr, a mixed martial artist consumed by his relentless pursuit of perfection and meaning in life. Beyond its compelling storytelling and stunning visuals, the film’s music stands out as a powerful narrative force, with Nala Sinephro’s OST perfectly encapsulating the turbulence of Kerr’s psyche.

"Locanda delle Fate" stands as one of Italy’s most regarded progressive rock bands of the 1970s. Their debut album "Forse le lucciole non si amano più" ("maybe fireflies don't love each other anymore") is considered by many a staple of the genre. The title track, a sprawling ten-minute fable, merges together delicate flutes, lush keyboards, and a hauntingly melancholic atmosphere that perfecly capture the bittersweet essence of summer’s end.

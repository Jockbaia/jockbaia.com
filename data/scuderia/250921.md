I periodically come back to "Pigro" ("Lazy"), my favourite record from Ivan Graziani. This time it's because of "Scappo di Casa" ("I run from home"), the closer of the album. A delicate song that beautifully describes the internal struggle of a boy whose wings are clipped by his mother’s overprotectiveness. Yet, despite this suffocating fate, his desire to discover the unexplored world of love is stronger than his parents' paranoia.

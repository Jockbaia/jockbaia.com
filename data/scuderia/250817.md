Franco Califano was one of Italy’s most iconic figures of the 1970s, embodying the archetype of the strong yet vulnerable man: charismatic with women, yet restless and unsatisfied. "Tac", the title track from one of his most celebrated albums, is a masterclass in bittersweet nostalgia: a reflection on missing someone only when they’re gone, and longing for solitude when they are back. The lush instrumentation and Franco’s silky voice blend seamlessly and, with this retro-futuristic allure, the opening moments of this track could almost be mistaken for a lost cut from Random Access Memories.

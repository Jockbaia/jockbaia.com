The singles leading to the album were right: this new Soulwax album marks a return to the gritty, electrifying sound that hooked me years ago. So many good tracks on there but "Hot Like Sahara" is something else: raw energy and a super intoxicating buildup on the last part. This track made me run faster on the last 10km run and I have my smartwatch data as proof. Just saying.
